## Leaflet

Sample leaflet - for detailed leaflet instructions, visit the FCOR 599 workshop archive page [here](https://ubc-mgem-fcor599.github.io/FCOR-599-Workshops/Interactive_Maps/leaflet.html).

```{r leaflet, include = FALSE}
library(dplyr); library(leaflet)

m <- leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldImagery") %>%
  addScaleBar(position = c("bottomleft")) %>%
  setView(-123.1207, 49.2827, zoom = 11)

```

```{r map, echo=FALSE}
m
```

## Code Snippets

Sample code snippet. Notice that you can provide a toggle to switch between coding languages - this is referred to as a 'tabset' in quarto. It is good practice to try and convert your R code to python, and vice-versa to demonstrate coding proficiency. For example, let's showcase a function for calculating NDVI in R and Python.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R

``` (.r)
calc_ndvi <- function(nir, red){
  ndvi <- (nir-red)/(nir+red)
  return(ndvi)
}
```

(Assuming *nir* and *red* are terra rast objects)

## Python

``` (.python)
def calc_ndvi(nir, red): 
  ndvi = (nir - red)/(nir + red)
  return(ndvi)
```

(Assuming *nir* and *red* are numpy arrays)

## External links

You can also provide a frame linking to external websites. For example, here is a Google Earth Engine application I developed - which I embedded in this webpage using the code below:

```{code}

<iframe width="900" height="700"
src="https://ee-melserramon.projects.earthengine.app/view/thermal-analysis-tool">
</iframe>
```

The full-screen GEE application is available [here](https://ee-melserramon.projects.earthengine.app/view/thermal-analysis-tool) in case you're interested.

(To use the GEE tool, navigate to any city you'd like, hit apply filters, and click anywhere on the map to retrieve a time-series of Landsat surface temperature observations for that point. Areas where the maximum temp exceeded 35 degrees Celsius in your date-range are highlighted in red.)
