## Background

Forests play a vital role in regulating the global carbon cycle, yet their aboveground biomass (AGB) remains difficult to estimate over large areas due to limitations of field-based measurements. Remote sensing offers a scalable solution, but the choice of satellite data remains challenging. This study addresses the challenge by evaluating satellite-based approaches to estimate AGB in Kwahu South, Ghana

## Objectives

- Identifying the optimal approach for estimating AGB in Ghana
- Evaluating the accuracy AGB estimation models derived from Landsat 9, PlanetSocpe, and 30-m PlanetScope with GEDI L4A serving as a reference data

## Datasets
- Landsat 9 imagery (date of the images: 12/2022)
- PlanetScope imagery (date of the images: 12/2022)
- GEDI L4A data (date of the data: 09/2022 to 02/2023)
- Digital Elevation Model (DEM)

## Method

The main approach for developing AGB estimation model in this project is as follow:
- Generated a rescaled 30-m PlanetScope imagery

- Calculated vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, NDWI, MSAVI, and GCI) from Landsat 9, PlanetScope, and rescaled 30-m PlanetScope imagery

- Computed the aspect from the DEM

- Applying random forest algorithm for AGB estimation with input variables were spectral bands, vegetation indices, aspect, and DEM. GEDI L4A was used as groundtruth data for validating each model

- Evaluated the accuracy of AGB estimation model derived from Landsat 9, PlanetScope, and rescaled 30-m PlanetScope

Though Planet had finer spatial resolution, it still demonstrated a less accurate result compared to Landsat 9. Meanwhile, the rescaled Planet provided the best performance, suggesting that spatial resolution alone did not determine AGB estimation accuracy. One potential explanation for this result is the misalignment between Planet’s 3m resolution and GEDI’s 25m footprint.That explains when the PlanetScope was rescaled to 30m, it better matched the scale of GEDI’s footprint, improving alignment and reducing fine-scale noise.


### AGB Distribution Map

:::

This map presents a sample of AGB predictions generated using Landsat 9 imagery. Due to licensing restrictions associated with PlanetScope data, maps derived from Planet imagery cannot be shared in this e-portfolio. However, a key takeaway from the comparison is the difference in how AGB is represented, especially in urban areas in the western part of the study region. In the Landsat 9 map, urban zones are less clearly separated from surrounding biomass values. In contrast, the AGB model based on PlanetScope data offers a smoother and more refined spatial distribution, improving the distinction between built-up and vegetated areas. This highlights the potential advantage of rescaling high-resolution data to a coarser resolution to enhance the consistency of AGB estimates by reducing noise while preserving meaningful spatial patterns.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this study evaluated the accuracy of AGB estimation models derived from Landsat 9 and PlanetScope, with GEDI L4A serving as reference. From the results, the most optimal model was identified. The findings demonstrated that finer resolution alone does not guarantee improved model performance. This study also emphasized the importance of matching the spatial scale of input data with reference measurements to enhance the accuracy of biomass prediction.
