# Detecting Change of Aboveground Biomass using Landsat 9 and PlanetScope data

::: panel-tabset
## Background

Forests play a vital role in regulating the global carbon cycle, yet their aboveground biomass (AGB) remains difficult to estimate over large areas due to limitations of field-based measurements. Remote sensing offers a scalable solution, but the choice of satellite data remains challenging. This study addresses the challenge by evaluating satellite-based approaches to estimate AGB in Kwahu South, Ghana

## Objectives

- Identifying the optimal approach for estimating AGB in Ghana
- Evaluating the accuracy AGB estimation models derived from Landsat 9, PlanetSocpe, and 30-m PlanetScope with GEDI L4A serving as a reference data

## Datasets
- Landsat 9 imagery (date of the images: 12/2022)
- PlanetScope imagery (date of the images: 12/2022)
- GEDI L4A data (date of the data: 09/2022 to 02/2023)
- Digital Elevation Model (DEM)

## Method

The main approach for developing AGB estimation model in this project is as follow:
- Generated a rescaled 30-m PlanetScope imagery
- Calculated vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, NDWI, MSAVI, and GCI) from Landsat 9, PlanetScope, and rescaled 30-m PlanetScope imagery
- Computed the aspect from the DEM
- Applying random forest algorithm for AGB estimation with input variables were spectral bands, vegetation indices, aspect, and DEM. GEDI L4A was used as groundtruth data for validating each model.
- Evaluated the accuracy of AGB estimation model derived from Landsat 9, PlanetScope, and rescaled 30-m PlanetScope.
