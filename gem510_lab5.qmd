## Background

Least cost path analysis is a spatial modeling technique used to determine the most efficient route between two points across a landscape, taking into account varying levels of resistance or "cost" associated with different land cover types or terrain features. This method is widely applied in wildlife conservation to model animal movement and habitat connectivity, especially for species affected by habitat fragmentation. In the case of Grizzly Bears (Ursus arctos horribilis), which require large, contiguous territories for foraging and migration, understanding movement corridors is critical for effective management and protection efforts. Human development and landscape alteration in regions like the Rocky Mountain foothills of western Alberta have significantly constrained Grizzly Bear movement. By applying least cost path analysis, researchers can identify potential wildlife corridors that minimize conflict with human activity and support long-term species viability.

The two maps illustrate least cost path (LCP) analyses for Grizzly Bear movement across a region in western Alberta, with resistance surfaces based on slope (left) and road networks (right). The slope-based LCP highlights terrain-driven movement, showing a more direct and topographically informed route through lower slope gradients, avoiding steep mountainous areas. This route suggests that Grizzly Bears may prefer to travel along more gradual slopes to minimize energy expenditure. In contrast, the road-based LCP results in a less direct, more fragmented path, indicating increased resistance in areas with dense road networks. Roads often act as physical and psychological barriers to wildlife, influencing movement behavior and habitat connectivity. This comparison underscores the importance of selecting appropriate cost surfaces based on ecological context. For conservation planning, incorporating multiple resistance factors—such as topography and human infrastructure—can provide a more comprehensive understanding of species movement and help identify priority areas for maintaining or restoring wildlife corridors.
