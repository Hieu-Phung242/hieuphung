## Background

In this task, Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used to perform supervised land cover classification from satellite imagery. GEE’s cloud-based platform allows efficient processing of large geospatial datasets and provides built-in machine learning tools for classification tasks. Three algorithms—Random Forest, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Naive Bayes—were applied to classify land cover types based on spectral signatures. The platform’s ability to integrate training data, run models at scale, and visualize outputs makes it an ideal tool for remote sensing applications.

## Objectives

-   Getting familiar with Google Earth Engine

-   Comparing the performance of three classification algorithms (Random Forest, CART, and Naive Bayes) in land cover mapping



## Data descriptions

-   Landsat 8 data

Among the models tested, Random Forest achieved the highest overall accuracy (89.5%), followed closely by CART (87.1%), while Naive Bayes performed the least accurately (76.6%). The superior performance of Random Forest can be attributed to its ability to handle high-dimensional data and reduce overfitting through ensemble learning. Although CART also demonstrated strong results, its single-tree structure may have limited its classification precision compared to the ensemble-based Random Forest. Naive Bayes, which relies on the assumption of feature independence, was less effective in capturing complex spectral patterns across land cover types. These results highlight the strength of ensemble methods like Random Forest in remote sensing applications and demonstrate GEE’s capacity to support scalable and comparative analysis of classification techniques.
