## Background

This work centers on stream network analysis to support salmon habitat assessment using GIS. Pacific salmon species, such as Chinook, Coho, Chum, Pink, and Sockeye, are integral to the ecological and cultural fabric of British Columbia, and their spawning success depends on specific freshwater habitat conditions. By extracting a stream network from a digital elevation model (DEM) using ArcGIS Pro, this work explores key physical characteristics like stream order and slope that influence spawning suitability. Vancouver Island serves as the study area due to its distinct hydrologic boundaries, which enable accurate flow accumulation and network modeling, and its relevance as a spawning ground where natural systems often intersect with human development.

## Objectives

-   Applying network topology to represent dams as barriers within the stream system

-   Use linear referencing to evaluate a capability model of salmon habitat along stream segments

-   Trace stream networks and calculate the extent of upstream salmon habitat accessible from given points

## Data descriptions

-   The data for this work was downloaded from UBC data source

Within the North East Vancouver Island Conservation Unit (NEVCU), two recorded dams play a significant role in limiting salmon access to portions of the stream network. The region features 143 unique coastal entry points where rivers meet the ocean, marking the origins of salmon migration into freshwater for spawning. Of the 5,137 stream segments analyzed, 4,210—or approximately 82%—are accessible to salmon, indicating relatively high connectivity. This may be attributed to the lower population density and reduced demand for infrastructure, such as dams, in the northern part of the island. However, 927 streams (about 18%) remain inaccessible, with the dams near Kains Lake and Brewster Lake contributing to this fragmentation. The exercise emphasizes the importance of understanding how human-made barriers affect critical salmon habitat and the extent of available spawning grounds.
