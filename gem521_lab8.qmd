## Background

Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is an advanced remote sensing technique that segments imagery into meaningful image objects rather than analyzing individual pixels. This method enhances classification by incorporating not only spectral characteristics but also spatial, shape, and contextual information. In this task, I used eCognition to conduct OBIA by applying a multiresolution segmentation algorithm, which grouped spectrally and spatially similar pixels into polygons. I then manually labeled a subset of these polygons with land cover classes such as forest, water, and urban areas. These labeled segments were used as training data for a Random Forest classifier, which was subsequently applied to classify the remaining objects in the image. This object-based approach provided a more structured and context-aware classification compared to traditional pixel-based methods.

The study area for analysis is at Malcom Knapp Research Forest.

## Objectives

-   Performing object-based image classification using multiresolution segmentation and Random Forest in eCognition

-   Classifying land cover types by leveraging both spectral and spatial characteristics of segmented image objects

## Data descriptions

-   Airborne Laser Scanning data

The image below presents the results of an object-based image analysis (OBIA) for forest structure classification. On the left, the segmented and classified image highlights distinct forest classes—Old Forest, Young Forest, Recent Harvest—and Water, derived using a multiresolution segmentation algorithm in eCognition. These segments represent homogeneous landscape units that capture both spectral and spatial characteristics of the environment. After segmentation, selected polygons were manually labeled to train a Random Forest classifier, which was then used to classify the remaining segments. The right side of the image displays the original false-color composite (NIR-Red-Green), where vegetation appears in shades of red and water bodies in black. The comparison demonstrates how OBIA enhances classification by aligning land cover boundaries with meaningful landscape features, offering a more accurate and interpretable result than traditional pixel-based methods.
