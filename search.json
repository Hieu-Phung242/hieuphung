Meanwhile, the rescaled Planet provided the best performance, suggesting that spatial resolution alone did not determine AGB estimation accuracy. One potential explanation for this result is the misalignment between Planet‚Äôs 3m resolution and GEDI‚Äôs 25m footprint.That explains when the PlanetScope was rescaled to 30m, it better matched the scale of GEDI‚Äôs footprint, improving alignment and reducing fine-scale noise.\n\n\nAGB Distribution Map\n\n\n\nThis map presents a sample of AGB predictions generated using Landsat 9 imagery. Due to licensing restrictions associated with PlanetScope data, maps derived from Planet imagery cannot be shared in this e-portfolio. However, a key takeaway from the comparison is the difference in how AGB is represented, especially in urban areas in the western part of the study region. In the Landsat 9 map, urban zones are less clearly separated from surrounding biomass values. In contrast, the AGB model based on PlanetScope data offers a smoother and more refined spatial distribution, improving the distinction between built-up and vegetated areas. This highlights the potential advantage of rescaling high-resolution data to a coarser resolution to enhance the consistency of AGB estimates by reducing noise while preserving meaningful spatial patterns."

In 2018, NDVI values are relatively low across the burned area, particularly in the central and southern regions, indicating limited photosynthetic activity and sparse vegetation cover shortly after the fire. By 2019, there is a slight increase in NDVI in scattered patches, suggesting the early stages of regrowth. This trend continues in 2020 and becomes more apparent in 2021, where broader areas show higher NDVI values (greener shades), reflecting increasing vegetation density and health. The gradual shift toward green and yellow tones over the four years indicates a progressive recovery of plant cover, although full canopy regeneration has not yet been achieved. These spatial NDVI patterns align with typical successional trajectories seen after wildfire events, where initial colonization by herbaceous species is followed by slower woody vegetation growth."

Their method identifies individual tree crowns by detecting local maxima in the CHM, then applies a region-growing algorithm to delineate tree boundaries based on vertical height differences. Each delineated crown is used to extract tree height and crown area, from which stem diameter and aboveground biomass are estimated using species-specific allometric equations.

Aside being a wonderful place for visitors, Hawaii archipelago is also home to Humpback Whales during the winter time. The whales swim from Alaska to Hawaii to mate, give birth, and nurture their calves (Hawaii Wildlife Fund, n.d). Recognized as one of the world‚Äôs most vital humpback whale habitats, the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary was established in 1992 to safeguard humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and their habitat in Hawai‚Äòi (Division of Aquatic Resources, n.d). However, there have been reports about collisions between whales and human activities and objects such as cruise ships, whale watching boats, and fishing boats. Therefore, government agencies are working to identify the most suitable and expansive areas to incorporate into the sanctuary.\nIn order to complete the tasks, suitability analysis and overlay analysis were performed. Suitability analysis is a process used to determine the suitability of an area for a particular use or purpose based on given weighted criteria (ESRI a, n.d). Overlay analysis is a common method used in suitability analysis, which combines multiple dataset to create a comprehensive assessment (ArcMap, n,d).\n\n\n\nThe main objectives of this task is to create areas of the 5 most suitable sanctuary for Humpback Whales in Hawaii based on the weighted suitability index.\n\n\n\n\nThe data is obtained from UBC-postgres database.

    "text": "Titan dioxide (TiO2) is used in the enhanced oxidation method because of its ability in photocatalysis. It has shown its potential in the application of removal contaminant in the environment. However, the ability of disposing contaminant of TiO2 is efficient only under a specific wavelength. Therefore, two methods have been researched in order to increase the ability of TiO2 in photocatalysis under UV ray and visible light. The first one is to add metal nanoparticles to the surface of TiO2. The other one is to attach nanocarbon dots on TiO2. In this thesis work, Graphene and gold nanoparticles were chosen as a support for the photocatalysis of TiO2.\nThe aim of this thesis is to research about the effect of Graphene/gold nanoparticles on the photocatalysis of TiO2. In addition, the ratio of gold and graphene also affected to the ability of photocatalysis. Therefore, different samples with various ratios were made to determine a necessary sample with a specific ratio. The color indicator such as blue methylene or Rhodamin B was used as a proxy for pollutants, in order to examine the efficiency of the photocatalysis between graphene/gold nanoparticles and TiO2.\nThe thesis topic is belonged to Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology.\n\n\nWhen the surface of TiO2 is illuminated by light with energy level similar or higher than the bandgap energy ŒîEbg, the electrons in the valence band are stimulated and moved to the conduction band (Thiruvenkatachari et al., 2006). As the electrons have moved to the conduction band, there are several holes in the valence band, and these holes are positive charge (h+).

The basic idea of this method is to use molten salts, with the help from anode and cathode, to capture and convert CO2 to valuable carbon-products such as carbon nanofiber (CNF), carbon nano onions (CNO), or carbon nanotubes (CNT). (Wu et al.¬†2017) Nevertheless, this technology has drawback. Several research showed that there were heavy corrosions on the anode used in molten salt electrolysis (Wu et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2018). Besides, lithium carbonate, which is mainly used in molten salt electrolysis, is becoming scarce (Reuter 2022). Hence, new carbonate salt and a suitable anode material should be researched to cope with the issue of corrsion and scarcity of lithium carbonate.\nThe main aim of this thesis work is to find suitable and inexpensive materials for electrodes to hold off the corrosion during molten salt electrolysis process. In addition, a system for molten carbonate salt electrolysis is designed and constructed for testing the materials in a laboratory scale system. Furthermore, the growth of CNT is investigated by zinc coated iron electrode to see if iron can catalyze the formation of CNT.\nThis thesis work is part of Hydrogen and Carbon Value Chains in Green Electrification (HYGCEL) project, in which new value chains from the development of Power-to-X (P2X) market was identified, plus, a guidance for electricity and hydrogen-based infrastructure should be examined. The work is in work package 5 (WP5), which concentrates on techno-economy of solid carbon products. The project is a collaborative project between Tampere University and Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology.\n\n\nIn direct reduction of CO2 to carbon, CO2 is converted directly to elemental carbon on the cathode during electrolysis of molten salt via a three-step electrochemical-chemical-electrochemical CO2 reduction (Ijije et al., 2014)\n\n1st step:\nCO2 + 2e- &lt;-&gt; CO22- (1)\n2nd step:\nCO22- -&gt; CO + O2- (2)\n3rd step:\nCO + 2e- -&gt; C + 2 CO32- (3)\nOverall reaction:\n3 CO2 + 4e- -&gt; C + 2 CO32- (4)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Illustration of the reduction of CO2 to carbon\n\n\n\nThe experimental system was designed for specific purposes. Several experiments were done to test the durability of anodes and formation of carbon products using different combination of carbonate salt. The anodes which were used in this thesis were nickel, tin dioxides (SnO2), and galvanized steel. The combination of salt used in this experiment were Li2CO3 and Na2CO3-K2CO3-CaCO3.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2Figure 3Figure 4Figure 5\n\n\n\nPreliminary design for a part of experimental systems\n\n\n\nSEM photo of carbon products when galvanized steel (cathode) and tin dioxide (anode) were used in Li2CO3\n\n\n\nSEM photo of carbon products when nickel (cathode) and tin dioxide (anode) were used in CaCO3-Na2CO3-K2CO3\n\n\n\nSEM photo of the surface of SnO2 for corrosion analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIjije, H.
