You can call me Harry.\nI am a fresh graduate student in Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management at The University of British Columbia.\nBefore coming to Canada, I have completed my Bachelor‚Äôs in Energy and Environmental Engineering at Tampere University of Applied Sciences in Finland. I also completed one Master‚Äôs programme in Environmental Engineering in Tampere University in Finland.\nIt is interesting that, after my first master‚Äôs graduation, I decided to revolve my career path to the field of GIS and Forestry because I recognized an interconnection between environment, forestry and remote sensing field.\nIn my e-portfolio, I hope to deliver insights, creativity and innovations to readers.\nThank you and enjoy your time exploring my space. Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to send me an email.\n\nSkills: ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, R coding, Python, ENVI, eCognition, Google Earth Enginer, AutoCAD, AutoCAD Plant 3D\n\n\n Contact Me"

    "text": "BackgroundObjectives\n\n\nForests play a vital role in regulating the global carbon cycle, yet their aboveground biomass (AGB) remains difficult to estimate over large areas due to limitations of field-based measurements. Remote sensing offers a scalable solution, but the choice of satellite data remains challenging. This study addresses the challenge by evaluating satellite-based approaches to estimate AGB in Kwahu South, Ghana\n\n\n\nIdentifying the optimal approach for estimating AGB in Ghana\nEvaluating the accuracy AGB estimation models derived from Landsat 9, PlanetSocpe, and 30-m PlanetScope with GEDI L4A serving as a reference data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample leaflet - for detailed leaflet instructions, visit the FCOR 599 workshop archive page here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample code snippet. Notice that you can provide a toggle to switch between coding languages - this is referred to as a ‚Äòtabset‚Äô in quarto. It is good practice to try and convert your R code to python, and vice-versa to demonstrate coding proficiency. For example, let‚Äôs showcase a function for calculating NDVI in R and Python.\n\nRPython\n\n\ncalc_ndvi &lt;- function(nir, red){\n  ndvi &lt;- (nir-red)/(nir+red)\n  return(ndvi)\n}\n(Assuming nir and red are terra rast objects)\n\n\ndef calc_ndvi(nir, red): \n  ndvi = (nir - red)/(nir + red)\n  return(ndvi)\n(Assuming nir and red are numpy arrays)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also provide a frame linking to external websites. For example, here is a Google Earth Engine application I developed - which I embedded in this webpage using the code below:\n\n\n&lt;iframe width=\"900\" height=\"700\"\nsrc=\"https://ee-melserramon.projects.earthengine.app/view/thermal-analysis-tool\"&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\nThe full-screen GEE application is available here in case you‚Äôre interested.\n(To use the GEE tool, navigate to any city you‚Äôd like, hit apply filters, and click anywhere on the map to retrieve a time-series of Landsat surface temperature observations for that point.
