Meanwhile, the rescaled Planet provided the best performance, suggesting that spatial resolution alone did not determine AGB estimation accuracy. One potential explanation for this result is the misalignment between Planet‚Äôs 3m resolution and GEDI‚Äôs 25m footprint.That explains when the PlanetScope was rescaled to 30m, it better matched the scale of GEDI‚Äôs footprint, improving alignment and reducing fine-scale noise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis map presents a sample of AGB predictions generated using Landsat 9 imagery. Due to licensing restrictions associated with PlanetScope data, maps derived from Planet imagery cannot be shared in this e-portfolio. However, a key takeaway from the comparison is the difference in how AGB is represented, especially in urban areas in the western part of the study region. In the Landsat 9 map, urban zones are less clearly separated from surrounding biomass values. In contrast, the AGB model based on PlanetScope data offers a smoother and more refined spatial distribution, improving the distinction between built-up and vegetated areas. This highlights the potential advantage of rescaling high-resolution data to a coarser resolution to enhance the consistency of AGB estimates by reducing noise while preserving meaningful spatial patterns.\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, this study evaluated the accuracy of AGB estimation models derived from Landsat 9 and PlanetScope, with GEDI L4A serving as reference. From the results, the most optimal model was identified. The findings demonstrated that finer resolution alone does not guarantee improved model performance.
