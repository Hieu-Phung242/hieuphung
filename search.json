Meanwhile, the rescaled Planet provided the best performance, suggesting that spatial resolution alone did not determine AGB estimation accuracy. One potential explanation for this result is the misalignment between Planet‚Äôs 3m resolution and GEDI‚Äôs 25m footprint.That explains when the PlanetScope was rescaled to 30m, it better matched the scale of GEDI‚Äôs footprint, improving alignment and reducing fine-scale noise.\n\n\nAGB Distribution Map\n\n\n\nThis map presents a sample of AGB predictions generated using Landsat 9 imagery. Due to licensing restrictions associated with PlanetScope data, maps derived from Planet imagery cannot be shared in this e-portfolio. However, a key takeaway from the comparison is the difference in how AGB is represented, especially in urban areas in the western part of the study region. In the Landsat 9 map, urban zones are less clearly separated from surrounding biomass values. In contrast, the AGB model based on PlanetScope data offers a smoother and more refined spatial distribution, improving the distinction between built-up and vegetated areas. This highlights the potential advantage of rescaling high-resolution data to a coarser resolution to enhance the consistency of AGB estimates by reducing noise while preserving meaningful spatial patterns."

In 2018, NDVI values are relatively low across the burned area, particularly in the central and southern regions, indicating limited photosynthetic activity and sparse vegetation cover shortly after the fire. By 2019, there is a slight increase in NDVI in scattered patches, suggesting the early stages of regrowth. This trend continues in 2020 and becomes more apparent in 2021, where broader areas show higher NDVI values (greener shades), reflecting increasing vegetation density and health. The gradual shift toward green and yellow tones over the four years indicates a progressive recovery of plant cover, although full canopy regeneration has not yet been achieved. These spatial NDVI patterns align with typical successional trajectories seen after wildfire events, where initial colonization by herbaceous species is followed by slower woody vegetation growth."

Their method identifies individual tree crowns by detecting local maxima in the CHM, then applies a region-growing algorithm to delineate tree boundaries based on vertical height differences. Each delineated crown is used to extract tree height and crown area, from which stem diameter and aboveground biomass are estimated using species-specific allometric equations.

Aside being a wonderful place for visitors, Hawaii archipelago is also home to Humpback Whales during the winter time. The whales swim from Alaska to Hawaii to mate, give birth, and nurture their calves (Hawaii Wildlife Fund, n.d). Recognized as one of the world‚Äôs most vital humpback whale habitats, the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary was established in 1992 to safeguard humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and their habitat in Hawai‚Äòi (Division of Aquatic Resources, n.d). However, there have been reports about collisions between whales and human activities and objects such as cruise ships, whale watching boats, and fishing boats. Therefore, government agencies are working to identify the most suitable and expansive areas to incorporate into the sanctuary.\nIn order to complete the tasks, suitability analysis and overlay analysis were performed. Suitability analysis is a process used to determine the suitability of an area for a particular use or purpose based on given weighted criteria (ESRI a, n.d). Overlay analysis is a common method used in suitability analysis, which combines multiple dataset to create a comprehensive assessment (ArcMap, n,d).\n\n\n\nThe main objectives of this task is to create areas of the 5 most suitable sanctuary for Humpback Whales in Hawaii based on the weighted suitability index.\n\n\n\n\nThe data is obtained from UBC-postgres database.

    "text": "Titan dioxide (TiO2) is used in the enhanced oxidation method because of its ability in photocatalysis. It has shown its potential in the application of removal contaminant in the environment. However, the ability of disposing contaminant of TiO2 is efficient only under a specific wavelength. Therefore, two methods have been researched in order to increase the ability of TiO2 in photocatalysis under UV ray and visible light. The first one is to add metal nanoparticles to the surface of TiO2. The other one is to attach nanocarbon dots on TiO2. In this thesis work, Graphene and gold nanoparticles were chosen as a support for the photocatalysis of TiO2.\nThe aim of this thesis is to research about the effect of Graphene/gold nanoparticles on the photocatalysis of TiO2. In addition, the ratio of gold and graphene also affected to the ability of photocatalysis. Therefore, different samples with various ratios were made to determine a necessary sample with a specific ratio. The color indicator such as blue methylene or Rhodamin B was used as a proxy for pollutants, in order to examine the efficiency of the photocatalysis between graphene/gold nanoparticles and TiO2.\nThe thesis topic is belonged to Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology.\n\n\nWhen the surface of TiO2 is illuminated by light with energy level similar or higher than the bandgap energy ŒîEbg, the electrons in the valence band are stimulated and moved to the conduction band (Thiruvenkatachari et al., 2006). As the electrons have moved to the conduction band, there are several holes in the valence band, and these holes are positive charge (h+).

    "section": "Applied Skills",
    "text": "Applied Skills\n\nAutoCAD 3D\nCO2 Captured using Molten Salt\nResearch\nScientific Writing\nExperimental Design\n\nCO2 capture via electrolysis in molten salt is one of the methods that draws attention of scientists and researchers due to its valuable product and sustainability. The basic idea of this method is to use molten salts, with the help from anode and cathode, to capture and convert CO2 to valuable carbon-products such as carbon nanofiber (CNF), carbon nano onions (CNO), or carbon nanotubes (CNT). (Wu et al.¬†2017) Nevertheless, this technology has drawback. Several research showed that there were heavy corrosions on the anode used in molten salt electrolysis (Wu et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2018). Besides, lithium carbonate, which is mainly used in molten salt electrolysis, is becoming scarce (Reuter 2022). Hence, new carbonate salt and a suitable anode material should be researched to cope with the issue of corrsion and scarcity of lithium carbonate.\nThe main aim of this thesis work is to find suitable and inexpensive materials for electrodes to hold off the corrosion during molten salt electrolysis process. In addition, a system for molten carbonate salt electrolysis is designed and constructed for testing the materials in a laboratory scale system. Furthermore, the growth of CNT is investigated by zinc coated iron electrode to see if iron can catalyze the formation of CNT.\nThis thesis work is part of Hydrogen and Carbon Value Chains in Green Electrification (HYGCEL) project, in which new value chains from the development of Power-to-X (P2X) market was identified, plus, a guidance for electricity and hydrogen-based infrastructure should be examined. The work is in work package 5 (WP5), which concentrates on techno-economy of solid carbon products. The project is a collaborative project between Tampere University and Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology.\n\nMechanism of CO2 capture and reduction using molten carbonate salt\nIn direct reduction of CO2 to carbon, CO2 is converted directly to elemental carbon on the cathode during electrolysis of molten salt via a three-step electrochemical-chemical-electrochemical CO2 reduction (Ijije et al., 2014)\n\n1st step:\nCO2 + 2e- &lt;-&gt; CO22- (1)\n2nd step:\nCO22- -&gt; CO + O2- (2)\n3rd step:\nCO + 2e- -&gt; C + 2 CO32- (3)\nOverall reaction:\n3 CO2 + 4e- -&gt; C + 2 CO32- (4)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Illustration of the reduction of CO2 to carbon\n\n\nExperimental methods\nThe experimental system was designed for specific purposes. Several experiments were done to test the durability of anodes and formation of carbon products using different combination of carbonate salt. The anodes which were used in this thesis were nickel, tin dioxides (SnO2), and galvanized steel. The combination of salt used in this experiment were Li2CO3 and Na2CO3-K2CO3-CaCO3.\n\n\nExample Results\n\nFigure 2Figure 3Figure 4Figure 5\n\n\n\nPreliminary design for a part of experimental systems\n\n\n\nSEM photo of carbon products when galvanized steel (cathode) and tin dioxide (anode) were used in Li2CO3\n\n\n\nSEM photo of carbon products when nickel (cathode) and tin dioxide (anode) were used in CaCO3-Na2CO3-K2CO3\n\n\n\nSEM photo of the surface of SnO2 for corrosion analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nIjije, H.

    "text": "Background\nThe San-Hoodia case is a key example of how Indigenous knowledge can connect with science, business, and international laws. It shows the challenges of recognizing traditional knowledge as a type of intellectual property and making sure Indigenous communities are fairly rewarded for their knowledge. In this case, the San people had used the Hoodia plant for centuries to suppress hunger. This knowledge later attracted scientists and pharmaceutical companies. As Hoodia became more commercially valuable, the case raised important issues about consent, ownership, and fair sharing of benefits. It has since played an important role in global discussions about Indigenous rights and bioprospecting."

    "text": "Description of ontology/worldview of the rightholders and stakeholders\n\nThe San PeopleThe Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)PhytopharmSouthern African Hoodia Growers Association (SAHGA)\n\n\nThe San people view Hoodia as a traditional resource with cultural and practical significance. They have used Hoodia as a food, a drink substitute and appetite suppressant. The San also use Hoodia for other purposes ‚Äúrecounted variously as to improve virility; to cure or treat hangovers, haemorrhoids, high blood pressure, pulmonary tuberculosis, stomach pains, flu, asthma and eye pain.‚Äù (Wynberg & Chennells, 2009). This suggests that the San see Hoodia as an integral part of their traditional knowledge and lifestyle, viewing it as a valuable plant that supports their survival in harsh conditions. Their ontology emphasizes communal sharing of knowledge and resources, contrasting with Western notions of intellectual property and commercialization. The San view their traditional knowledge of Hoodia as collective intellectual property that should not be owned by any individual or entity (Wynberg & Chennells, 2009). The evidence for this ontology is ‚ÄúTraditional knowledge of plants is viewed as collective and the idea of ‚Äòowning‚Äô life is abhorrent.‚Äù (Wynberg & Chennells, 2009).\n\n\nCSIR initially viewed Hoodia as a potential commercial product, recognizing its properties for development into an appetite suppressant and anti-obesity drug (Leveraging Economic Growth through Benefit Sharing, n.d.). They patented the findings and pursued partnerships with companies like Phytopharm and Pfizer to commercialize the plant‚Äôs potential. This ontology treats Hoodia as a resource to be studied, modified, and exploited for profit, prioritizing intellectual property rights and market potential over the traditional knowledge systems that initially guided their research. The evidence for this statement is found in this sentence ‚ÄúIn 1998, CSIR signed a licensing agreement for further development and commercialization of the product‚Äù (Wynberg & Chennells, 2009).\n\n\nPhytopharm‚Äôs worldview of Hoodia was primarily commercial. They saw it as a business opportunity, patenting the active ingredient P57 and promoting it as a potential natural cure for obesity. Their initial approach overlooked the indigenous knowledge source, as evidenced by their chief executive‚Äôs belief that the people who discovered the plant‚Äôs effects had disappeared. ‚ÄúPhytopharm‚Äôs Richard Dixey as having been told by the CSIR that the 100000 strong San ‚Äòno longer existed‚Äô.‚Äù (Wynberg & Chennells, 2009).\n\n\nSAHGA represents commercial Hoodia cultivators in Southern Africa who are primarily concerned with cultivating Hoodia for the herbal and dietary supplement market (Wynberg & Chennells, 2009). The SAHGA appears to view Hoodia primarily as a commercial crop with significant economic potential. This is evidenced by their agreement to pay a percentage of farmgate sales to the Working Group of Indigenous Minorities in Southern Africa (WIMSA) (Amusan, 2016). Unlike Phytopharm, SAHGA‚Äôs perspective is closer to the ground, with an emphasis on the cultivation process, environmental sustainability, and local economic benefits. While they acknowledge the San‚Äôs role as traditional knowledge holders, their engagement is shaped by compliance with biodiversity and bioprospecting legislation rather than cultural or moral obligations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSan Hoodia Flora (Wikimedia Common, CC-BY-SA-4.0)"

    "text": "Recognition of the San as Traditional Knowledge Holders\nThis section outlines the key reasons why the San were ultimately recognized as the legitimate holders of traditional knowledge related to Hoodia. The first reason for naming the San as the holders of the traditional knowledge of Hoodia is their historical precedence. The San are recognized as the oldest human inhabitants of southern Africa, having lived as hunters and gatherers in the region for thousands of years. This long-standing presence supports their claims as the original holders of Hoodia-related knowledge, predating other groups who later migrated to the region.\nThe second reason is the documented early use. As it was written in the article of Wynberg & Chennels, (2009), colonial botanical accounts, such as those by Francis Masson in 1798 and Rudolf Marloth in 1932, specifically mention the San‚Äôs use of Hoodia as an appetite suppressant and thirst quencher. These early documentations directly link the traditional knowledge of Hoodia to the San, strengthening their claims as the primary holders of this knowledge."

    "section": "Transboundary Challenges in the Governance of Hoodia",
    "text": "Transboundary Challenges in the Governance of Hoodia\nOne of the key transboundary challenges in the governance of Hoodia was the shared distribution of both the plant and the associated traditional knowledge across national borders. Hoodia grows naturally in South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana, and its uses have been known among various Indigenous groups within these regions. While the San were officially recognized as the primary holders of Hoodia-related knowledge, other communities such as the Nama, Damara, and Topnaar also had documented histories of using the plant. This overlap created tension around the rightful ownership of knowledge and the fair distribution of benefits. To address this, the San, through the Working Group of Indigenous Minorities in Southern Africa (WIMSA), adopted a unified stance by declaring that their cultural heritage was indivisible. As a result, benefit-sharing was structured to be distributed equally among all San peoples, regardless of their national location‚Äîhelping to avoid internal conflict and facilitate cross-border negotiations.\nAnother major challenge stemmed from the differences in national legal and policy frameworks related to bioprospecting and traditional knowledge. South Africa had a formal legislative structure, including the Biodiversity Act, which mandated benefit-sharing agreements. However, at the time, Namibia and Botswana lacked equivalent laws, which made it difficult to align benefit-sharing mechanisms across countries. These discrepancies posed significant hurdles in ensuring fairness, legal compliance, and consistency in implementation. To overcome these issues, WIMSA and legal representatives of the San worked closely with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to design agreements that were adaptable to different legal contexts, while still protecting the collective rights of the San across all three countries."

    "section": "Concerns with Commercialization and Benefit Sharing",
    "text": "Concerns with Commercialization and Benefit Sharing\nMany San community members expressed dissatisfaction with the way Hoodia was commercialized and how benefit-sharing agreements were handled. A primary concern was the lack of meaningful involvement and access to information during the negotiation process. Although legislation to protect Indigenous knowledge was being developed in South Africa, the San were not consulted about its scope or content. As a result, they were left to negotiate without the support of a legal framework mandating equitable benefit sharing. Within the communities, individuals felt excluded from decision-making, and some believed that the San Hoodia Trust‚Äîestablished to manage and distribute benefits‚Äîhad not sufficiently communicated the terms or implications of the agreement to the wider San population.\nBeyond procedural issues, cultural and symbolic concerns also played a significant role. For the San, Hoodia is not merely a medicinal plant but a vital source of food, water, and energy deeply embedded in their cultural identity. Commercial cultivation and the transformation of the plant into pills and dietary supplements were viewed by some as stripping Hoodia of its traditional meaning and spiritual power, which is believed to be rooted in its natural habitat. Additionally, the exploitation of Indigenous knowledge by companies that marketed Hoodia-based products without consent or fair compensation further intensified discontent. Some products used the image and story of the San to promote their goods while bypassing the benefit-sharing agreement entirely. This unauthorized use disrespected San heritage and denied them rightful economic benefits. As highlighted in the case, one advertisement even criticized pharmaceutical companies for sidelining Indigenous peoples‚Äîwhile doing precisely that in its own marketing."

    "text": "Least Cost Path Map\n\n\n\nThe two maps illustrate least cost path (LCP) analyses for Grizzly Bear movement across a region in western Alberta, with resistance surfaces based on slope (left) and road networks (right). The slope-based LCP highlights terrain-driven movement, showing a more direct and topographically informed route through lower slope gradients, avoiding steep mountainous areas. This route suggests that Grizzly Bears may prefer to travel along more gradual slopes to minimize energy expenditure. In contrast, the road-based LCP results in a less direct, more fragmented path, indicating increased resistance in areas with dense road networks. Roads often act as physical and psychological barriers to wildlife, influencing movement behavior and habitat connectivity. This comparison underscores the importance of selecting appropriate cost surfaces based on ecological context. For conservation planning, incorporating multiple resistance factors, such as topography and human infrastructure, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of species movement and help identify priority areas for maintaining or restoring wildlife corridors."
