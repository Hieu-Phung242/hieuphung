In 2018, NDVI values are relatively low across the burned area, particularly in the central and southern regions, indicating limited photosynthetic activity and sparse vegetation cover shortly after the fire. By 2019, there is a slight increase in NDVI in scattered patches, suggesting the early stages of regrowth. This trend continues in 2020 and becomes more apparent in 2021, where broader areas show higher NDVI values (greener shades), reflecting increasing vegetation density and health. The gradual shift toward green and yellow tones over the four years indicates a progressive recovery of plant cover, although full canopy regeneration has not yet been achieved. These spatial NDVI patterns align with typical successional trajectories seen after wildfire events, where initial colonization by herbaceous species is followed by slower woody vegetation growth."

    "title": "Proposal: Evaluating the Impact of Landsacape Fragmentation on Carbon Sequestration of Forests in Kwahu South, Ghana using Landscape Metrics and Landsat 8 Data",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction: It is ambiguous that highly fragmented forest enhances carbon sequestration ability.\nIn recent years, the impact of forest fragmentation on carbon sequestration has become a topic of intense scientific debate (Hou et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2017). The increasing fragmentation of forest landscapes poses a significant threat to their ecosystem service (Fischer et al., 2021). While studies suggest that landscape fragmentation leads to reduced carbon storage capacity due to an increase in edge effects (Fischer et al., 2021), others have reported opposite findings (Lei et al., 2024). A recent study in subtropical forests found that carbon uptake capacity per unit area was enhanced in highly fragmented forest landscape (Jiao et al., 2024). The controversies of carbon uptake capacity between fragmented forest and continuous forest have prompted the need for further research in diverse forest ecosystems.\nTo address this research gap, my study aims to evaluate the impact of landscape fragmentation on carbon sequestration of forest in Kwahu South, Ghana. Additionally, the impact of landscape fragmentation in the studied area on carbon absorption ability remain poorly understood. In this study, I will use landscape metrics derived from satellite imagery (Landsat 8) and combine them with carbon stock estimates to quantify the relationship between forest fragmentation and carbon sequestration capacity.\n\n\nMethods\nThe satellite imagery of Landsat 8 from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) with spatial resolution of 30 meters will be downloaded (EarthExplorer, n.d.). I will perform supervised classification using Random Forest algorithm to create a forest/non-forest map. Using landscape metrics package in RStudio, I will calculate landscape metrics such as Patch Density (PD), Edge Density (ED), Mean Patch Size (MPS), Largest Patch Index (LPI), and Euclidean Nearest Neighbor Distance (ENN). The description for each metric is shown in Table 1. To estimate carbon stocks, I will utilize allometric equations developed by Aabeyir et al.¬†(2020) in combination with field measurements of diameter at breast height and tree height supplied by Ostrom Climate. I will also use the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Landsat 8 as a proxy for biomass, calibrating it with the field data. Finally, I will use linear regression to quantify the relationship between the calculated metrics and the estimated carbon stocks (Lei et al., 2024). The results allow me to assess how different fragmentation patterns relate to carbon sequestration capacity in the area.\n\n\nExpected results and significance\nI expect a negative correlation between fragmentation metrics (such as Edge Density and Patch Density) and carbon sequestration capacity. Specifically, area with higher edge density will show lower carbon stocks due to increased edge effect. In addition, continuous forest patches (indicated by higher Mean Patch Size and Largest Patch Index) will demonstrate greater carbon sequestration capacity. Similar findings have been observed in research indicating that, in non-commercial forests, fragmentation reduces the carbon storage due to the influence of patch area, edge and patchy connection(Lei et al., 2024). The Figure 1 illustrates the correlation between each fragmentation metric and its corresponding carbon stock.\nThe results will provide implications such as climate change mitigation. Understanding how fragmentation affects carbon storage can contribute to more accurate estimates of carbon stocks and potential emissions from forest degradation. Another significance from this study is demonstration of carbon sequestration benefits of maintaining large and contiguous forest patches. This insight is particularly significant for guiding conservation strategies and improving land management practices.\n\n\nFigures and Tables\nTable 1.

This top-down, region-growing approach begins by identifying the highest point in the cloud, assumed to be a tree top, and sequentially classifies neighboring points based on 2D spatial distance, adaptive spacing thresholds, and tree shape characteristics. By leveraging the 3D structure of the forest, the algorithm effectively distinguishes individual trees even in complex, overlapping canopies.\n\n\nCode\n#segment trees using li2012 algorithm \nsegmented_plot_1 &lt;- segment_trees(Lab5_Plot_1, li2012(dt1 = 1.5, \n                                                      dt2 = 2, \n                                                      R = 2, \n                                                      Zu = 15, \n                                                      speed_up = 10, \n                                                      hmin = 2))\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Detect individual trees using a CHM\nDalponte and Coomes (2016) developed a tree-centric approach for individual tree detection (ITD) using canopy height models (CHMs) derived from airborne laser scanning. Their method identifies individual tree crowns by detecting local maxima in the CHM, then applies a region-growing algorithm to delineate tree boundaries based on vertical height differences. Each delineated crown is used to extract tree height and crown area, from which stem diameter and aboveground biomass are estimated using species-specific allometric equations. Hyperspectral imagery aids in tree species classification, enabling more accurate wood density assignment. This CHM-based ITD framework enables high-resolution carbon density mapping, though it is limited in detecting small understory trees hidden beneath the canopy.\nFigure 2.

The whales swim from Alaska to Hawaii to mate, give birth, and nurture their calves (Hawaii Wildlife Fund, n.d). Recognized as one of the world‚Äôs most vital humpback whale habitats, the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary was established in 1992 to safeguard humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and their habitat in Hawai‚Äòi (Division of Aquatic Resources, n.d).

Therefore, government agencies are working to identify the most suitable and expansive areas to incorporate into the sanctuary.\nIn order to complete the tasks, suitability analysis and overlay analysis were performed. Suitability analysis is a process used to determine the suitability of an area for a particular use or purpose based on given weighted criteria (ESRI a, n.d).
